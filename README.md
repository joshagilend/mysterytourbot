# Overview

This repository outlines how to use the __Mystery-Bot__, an RSS reader for a mystery character's mystery world tour.

# Installation

Run the software locally by running the following command: 

`% python app.py`

This will generate a Chrome website `mystery.html` which you can use to read the mystery character's latest travel updates in an easy and intuitive way.

# Usage

Each time you want to read the page, you will need to run the installation command. This will grab the latest updates from the web, and update the website.

# Inspiration

The original nuts and bolts of this website was built in a single day by Josh at [agilend.net](https://agilend.net). He is a programmer based in San Francisco and Los Angeles, in the sunny California coast.
